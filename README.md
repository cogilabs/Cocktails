# Cogilabs Cocktails
[→ En Français](/localizedReadme/README-fr.md)  

### ***Warning: Fully in developpement***

The main aim of the project is to help me learn vue.js.  
  
It has been built on an idea by [idoleY](https://github.com/idoleY) and with his help for design and cocktail choice.

You can check the last deployed version on [cocktails.cogilabs.eu](https://cocktails.cogilabs.eu).

## What is it?

It's a cocktail maker!  
Jokes aside, it allows ou to know what cocktails you can make with the ingredients you have in front of you. Just select the ingredients and the cocktail recipies come to you!
